# What difference between priority queue and normal queue?
# In a noraml queue, the first-in-first-out rule is implemented whereas, in a
# priority queue, the values are removed on the basis of priority. The item with
# the highest pripority is removed first.
# Basic operations of a pripority queue are inserting, removing, and peeking
# items.
