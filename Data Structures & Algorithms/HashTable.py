# The Hash table ds stores items in key-value pairs where
# key   - unique integer that is used for indexing the values
# value - data that are associated with keys.
# In a hash table, a new index is processed using the keys. And, the item
# corresponding to that key is stored in the index. This process is called
# hashing.
