# Deque or Double Ended Queue is a type of queue in which insertion and
# removal of items can either be performed from the front or the rear. Thus, it
# does not follow FIFO rule(First In First Out).
# Types of Deque:
# - Input restricted deque - input is restricted at a single end but allows
# deletion at both the ends.
# - Output restricted deque - output is restricted at a single end but allows
# insertion at both the ends.
